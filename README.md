##  :clipboard: Description

This project is a back-end book management API built using the Express framework in Node.js, with TypeScript, and Prisma for database operations. The API enables users to track the books they've read and, upon completing a book, allows them to provide ratings and reviews. In the context of this project, the application is intended for use by a single user, providing them with the means to organize their readings and document their opinions on the books they've read.
